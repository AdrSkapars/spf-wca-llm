I'm experimenting with a program and trying to find what makes an increasingly large set of inputs valid. So far I have found one possible set of correct constraints/ conditions (not the only one) which define a valid input. Here they are.

Valid constraints for 1 inputs (N=1):
in0 == 120

Valid constraints for 2 inputs (N=2):
in1 == 120, in0 == 120

Valid constraints for 3 inputs (N=3):
in2 == 120, in1 == 120, in0 == 120

Valid constraints for 4 inputs (N=4):
in3 == 120, in2 == 120, in1 == 120, in0 == 120

Valid constraints for 5 inputs (N=5):
in4 == 120, in3 == 120, in2 == 120, in1 == 120, in0 == 120

Valid constraints for 6 inputs (N=6):
in5 == 120, in4 == 120, in3 == 120, in2 == 120, in1 == 120, in0 == 120

Valid constraints for 7 inputs (N=7):
in6 == 120, in5 == 120, in4 == 120, in3 == 120, in2 == 120, in1 == 120, in0 == 120

Valid constraints for 8 inputs (N=8):
in7 == 120, in6 == 120, in5 == 120, in4 == 120, in3 == 120, in2 == 120, in1 == 120, in0 == 120

Valid constraints for 9 inputs (N=9):
in8 == 120, in7 == 120, in6 == 120, in5 == 120, in4 == 120, in3 == 120, in2 == 120, in1 == 120, in0 == 120

Valid constraints for 10 inputs (N=10):
in9 == 120, in8 == 120, in7 == 120, in6 == 120, in5 == 120, in4 == 120, in3 == 120, in2 == 120, in1 == 120, in0 == 120

Generalise what makes the set of constraints valid such that we can recover a valid set for N inputs. Don't overfit the data here but also dont oversimplify to the point of trivialness. Make sure none of the given examples contradict your generalisation.

Use this code template to formally express the generalisation for N constraints:
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = []

    # Do some logic here to append constraints

    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)
constraints = ", ".join(constraints)
print(constraints)```

Each inequality is usually in the form "x op y" where x, y are some variable, constant or some formula of variables and/ or constants, and op is an operation or inequality.

CASUAL: 
To define the valid constraints for N inputs, we can observe that each input should be equal to 120, and the indices of the inputs should follow a specific pattern. The indices of inputs range from N-1 to 0, and the value of each input should be the same, i.e., 120. Therefore, the general constraints for N inputs can be given as:
- in_i == 120, where i ranges from N-1 to 0.

Generalization for `N` constraints:
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = [f"in{i} == 120" for i in range(N-1, -1, -1)]
    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)
constraints = ", ".join(constraints)
print(constraints)
```

Always respond first with an informal analysis in natural language and maybe some mathematics (under the heading 'CASUAL', all caps), then with a formal Python program answer inside a code block (under the heading 'FORMAL', all caps). Make sure there is only one code block in your answer.

CASUAL:
The general rule seems to be that for any given `N`, the constraint `in_i == 120` should hold true for each `i` ranging from `N-1` to `0`. This suggests a pattern where the input indices count down from `N-1` to `0` and are compared to 120.

FORMAL:
```python
def generate_constraints(N):
    constraints = [f"in{i} == 120" for i in range(N-1, -1, -1)]
    return constraints

N = int(input("N="))
constraints = generate_constraints(N)
constraints = ", ".join(constraints)
print(constraints)
```
