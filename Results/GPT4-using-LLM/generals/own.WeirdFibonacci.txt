Amending the naming conventions used in the generalisation, we find:

For a program with N inputs, where N >= 3, the valid constraints can be defined as follows:

For every integer i from N-1 down to 2, create a constraint:

'in'+i == 'in'+(i-2) + 'in'+(i-1)

Once again, for N < 3, no constraints are defined.
