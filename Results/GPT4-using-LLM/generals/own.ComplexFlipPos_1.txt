Let C denote the set of constraints.

- For N=1, there are no constraints:
C = {}

- For N=2 or N=3, we have the following constraints:
C = {in1 < in0}

- For N=4 or N=5, the constraints should be:
C = {in3 < in2, in1 < in0, in0 < in3}

- For N=6 and any even N>6, the constraints should be structured as per the following rules:
1. For every i from N-1 to 5, decrementing by -2 each step, we add the pair of constraints: 'in' + str(i-1) + ' < in' + str(i-2) and 'in' + str(i-3) + ' < in' + str(i-4).
2. We add the constraint: 'in0 < in' + str(N-2).

- For N=7 and any odd N>7, the constraints should be structured as per the following rules:
1. For every i from N-1 to 6, decrementing by -2 each step, we add the pair of constraints: 'in' + str(i-1) + ' < in' + str(i-2) and 'in' + str(i-3) + ' < in' + str(i-4).
2. We add the constraints: 'in0 < in' + str(N-3) and 'in2 < in' + str(N-1).

- Furthermore, for all N>=2, add the constraint 'in1 < in0'.

This update should match more closely with the examples provided and properly capture the intricate pattern of the inputs and constraints.
