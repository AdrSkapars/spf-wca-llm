For a given number N of inputs, where the inputs are in0, in1, ..., inN-1, the set of valid constraints C can be generalised as follows:

If N=2:
- C: in1 < in0

If N=3:
- C: in0 < in2, in1 < in0

For Nâ‰¥4:

- For i from 0 to N-3: C[i] = "in" + str(i) + " < in" + str(i+2)
- An additional constraint: in[N - (4 - N%2)] < in0

This should conform to all patterns observed in the example constraints, from 1 to 10 inputs.
