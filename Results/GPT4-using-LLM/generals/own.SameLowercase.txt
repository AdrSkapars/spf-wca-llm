For any given number of N inputs, the conditions for each input inX are as follows:

- The subscript X of inX ranges from 0 to N-1. 
- for each value of X, instead of 97 <= inX <= 122, the correct format is as follows:
  - inX <= 122 
  - inX >= 97 

This prediction holds true for all the newly provided examples.
