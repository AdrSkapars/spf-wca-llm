For an arbitrary N (where N is number of inputs and N >=2), a set of valid constraints can be defined as follows:

- if N is even, for i in range(0, N-1):
  - if i%2 == 0: in[i] == in[i+1]
  - else if i%2 != 0: in[i] < in[i+1]

- if N is odd, for i in range(0, N-1):
  - if i%2 == 0: in[i] < in[i+1]
  - else if i%2 != 0: in[i] == in[i+1]

For N=1, no constraints are needed. This pattern should accurately categorise the provided examples and can be generalised to any number of inputs N.
