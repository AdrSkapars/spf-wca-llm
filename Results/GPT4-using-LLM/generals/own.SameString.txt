To correctly represent the constraints for any given N inputs, we should present them in reverse order with the number 120 shown on the left side of the equality. In this case, for any N:

Our constraints should be represented in the format: 

120 == in_i for i descending from N-1 down to 0.

This implies: {120 == in_N-1, 120 == in_N-2, ..., 120 == in_0}, which correctly fits the format of the constraints given in the data.
