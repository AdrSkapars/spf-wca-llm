I'm experimenting with a program and trying to find what makes an increasingly large set of inputs valid. So far I have found one possible set of correct constraints/ conditions (not the only one) which define a valid input. Here they are.

Generalise what makes the set of constraints valid such that we can recover a valid set for N inputs. Don't overfit the data here but also dont oversimplify to the point of trivialness. Make sure none of the given examples contradict your generalisation.

CASUAL:

Looking at these constraints, we can see a clear pattern. The valid constraints for any set of N inputs (starting from N=3), are defined for each individual input in the set (counting starts from 0). For each input (inx, where x represents the input order from 0 to N-1), the conditions are the same: the input must be equal to 37, and must not equal to 36, 35, or 64. This holds true for every single input in the set, from in0 all the way to inN-1. It looks like the constraints are just ensuring that all the inputs must be equal to 37, but not equal to 36, 35 or 64.

FORMAL:

The pattern can be generalized such that for each input 'inx' in a set of N inputs (N>=3), the following constraints hold:

inx == 37, 
inx != 36, 
inx != 35, 
inx != 64

where 'inx' denotes the xth input in set N, x ranges from 0 to N-1.

############################################################
Remember to always structure your reply with the same headings. I have applied you generalisation for several concrete values of N. Some of the outputs were not correct. Change your generalisation to account for the following outputs (Remember to always structure your reply with the headings 'CASUAL' and 'FORMAL').

For N=1, the generalisation output correctly fits the given data

For N=2, the output constraint set should be:
```
None
```
But your generalisation implies the set:
```
in0 == 37, in0 != 36, in0 != 35, in0 != 64, in1 == 37, in1 != 36, in1 != 35, in1 != 64
```
This is not right. Explanation: The correct set is empty while the predicted set contains a list of inequalities. Therefore they are different.

For N=3, the generalisation output correctly fits the given data

For N=4, the generalisation output correctly fits the given data

For N=5, the generalisation output correctly fits the given data

For N=6, the generalisation output correctly fits the given data

For N=7, the generalisation output correctly fits the given data

For N=8, the generalisation output correctly fits the given data

For N=9, the generalisation output correctly fits the given data

For N=10, the generalisation output correctly fits the given data

CASUAL:

I see the discrepancy. We were previously assuming that the constraints start to apply from N=3 onwards. However, it seems the constraints actually start to apply from N=3 and are not applicable when N<3, as indicated in the example for N=2. We need to modify the conditions for this case. 

FORMAL:

The pattern can be generalized such that for each input 'inx' in a set of N inputs:

- No constraints for N<3.
- for N>=3, the following constraints apply for each input from x=0 to N-1:

inx == 37, 
inx != 36, 
inx != 35, 
inx != 64
