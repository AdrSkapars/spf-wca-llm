Given the feedback, the current generalization does not accurately represent the valid constraints for the given scenarios (N=2, N=3, N=4, N=5, N=6, N=7, N=8, N=9, and N=10). The predicted sets are empty and do not align with the correct sets, which contain multiple inequality constraints.

Therefore, a comprehensive update is necessary to ensure that the generalization reflects the valid constraints for different input sizes.
